# rpn
A simple RPN calculator written in Rust.

The calculator is very loosely inspired by my favorite calculator of all time; HP 15C. It is however not meant to become a clone, after all it lacks both the benefits and limitations of having a dedicated hardware to run on.

To be honest it's currently not much of a calculator anyway. It's more me needing some kind of reason to learn Rust since I prefer "learning by doing" rather than studying a topic in the more traditional way. When you read the code or feel that the functionality is lacking, please keep that in mind.
